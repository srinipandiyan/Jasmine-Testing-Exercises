## **Loan Calculator**

You are given the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a loan calculator. Your goal is to fill in the JavaScript to make the loan calculator functional. The calculator takes an amount to loan (the *principle*), a term in years, and a yearly rate. The output should be the monthly payment of the loan.

To calculate the monthly payment, use the following formula:

$$
\text{monthly payment} = \frac{P \times i}{\rule{0pt}{1em} 1 - {(1 + i)}^{-n}}
$$

monthly payment=𝑃×𝑖1−(1+𝑖)−𝑛monthly payment=P×i1−(1+i)−n

Where:

- ***P*** = Amount of principle
- ***i*** = periodic interest rate (in our case yearly rate ÷ 12)
- ***n*** = total number of payments (years × 12)

There is also a jasmine test file (***calculator-test.js***). Your goal is to write tests for the ***calculateMontlyPayment*** function. There are a few suggested tests, but if you can think of more, feel free to add to it.

## **Further Study: Tip Pool**

In this exercise you will take an existing code base and write tests using the Jasmine testing library.

‘Tip Pool’ is an application that tracks the total tips generated from a group of servers in a restaurant. It then calculates the payout for each server.

Your task is to thoroughly test each function in the app!

## **Step One: Complete server.test.js**

Take a minute to read through the codebase, currently there is only one test in `server.test.js`

Notice that the string ‘Alice’ is getting left on the dom after the first test is run, this is because we didn’t tear down our tests properly

To get started:

- Thoroughly read the code base
- Clean up the dom after the test is run using `afterEach`
- Write a test for each function found in `server.js`

## **Step Two: Test the remainder of the app**

Repeat the process from step one for `payments.js` and `helpers.js`

- Create a `helpers.test.js` file and test each function in `helpers.js`
- Create a `payments.test.js` file and test each function in `payments.js`
- When finished you should have three .test.js files one for each .js file

## **Step Three: Test your own code**

Get a feel for testing your own code

First we will build out functionality for removing a server from the server table

- Review the functionality of `appendTd(tr, value)`
- Create a `appendDeleteBtn(tr)`, it will be similar to `append(tr, value)`. This function will create a ‘td’ with the value ‘X’, when clicked it will delete the table row it belongs to
- Write the functionality for appending a ‘td’ to a ‘tr’ with the value ‘X’
- Set an click event listener on the ‘td’ that will remove the parent ‘tr’ from the dom. You will have to find a way to access the parent row of the ‘td’ from the click event
- Write tests for `appendDeleteBtn(tr)`
    
    You may notice the difficulty of simulating a click with vanilla javascript so do not spend too much time on testing the html after the DOM is updated (later we will study approaches for this with other libraries).
    
- Repeat the process for removing a payment from the payment table
